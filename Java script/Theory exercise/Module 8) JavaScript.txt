Module 8) JavaScript 

JavaScript Introduction

Theory Assignment

Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development
ANS:JavaScript is a high-level, scripting programming language used to make web pages interactive, dynamic, and functional.
HTML creates the structure of a webpage, CSS adds style, and JavaScript brings the webpage to life.

Examples of JavaScript:

Click buttons to show/hide content

Popup messages

Form validation

Animations

Live updates without page reload

Role of JavaScript in

Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?
ANS:JavaScript is mainly used for web development and runs in the browser, while Python is used in data science, AI, and automation, and Java is used for enterprise and Android applications. JavaScript is dynamically typed and interpreted, while Java is statically typed and compiled. Python has simple syntax, Java has strict syntax, and JavaScript focuses on web interactivity.

Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external
JavaScript file to an HTML document?
Ans:Use of <script> tag in HTML

The <script> tag is used in HTML to insert or link JavaScript code into a webpage.
It allows you to:

Add JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file

Link external JavaScript files

Control where JavaScript runs (head or body)

Make webpages dynamic and interactive

Example of inline JavaScript using <script> tag
<script>
  alert("Hello, this is JavaScript!");
</script>





Variables and Data Types

Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let,and
const?
ANS:Variables in JavaScript are containers used to store data values.
They hold information that can be used and changed in a program.

Example of data stored in variables:

Numbers

Strings (text)

Boolean (true/false)

Objects

Arrays

JavaScript variables allow you to store, update, and use these values throughout the code.
1. var

Old way to create variables

Function-scoped

Value can be reassigned

Allows redeclaration (not recommended)

Example:
var x = 10;
x = 20;    // allowed
var x = 30; // allowed

2. let

Modern way to declare variables

Block-scoped

Value can be changed (reassigned)

Cannot be redeclared in the same block

Example:
let y = 15;
y = 25;       // allowed
// let y = 30;  // ❌ not allowed

3. const

Used for constant values

Block-scoped

Value cannot be changed (no reassignment)

Must be initialized when declared

Example:
const z = 50;
// z = 60;   // ❌ not allowed

Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each.
ANS:A. Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types store single values and are immutable.

1. Number

Represents numeric values (integer or decimal).

Example:

let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;

2. String

Represents text (characters inside quotes).

Example:

let name = "John";
let city = 'Mumbai';

3. Boolean

Represents true or false.

Example:

let isLoggedIn = true;
let isStudent = false;

4. Undefined

A variable declared but not assigned any value.

Example:

let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

5. Null

Represents empty or no value.

Example:

let data = null;

6. BigInt

Used for very large numbers.

Example:

let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;

7. Symbol

Represents a unique value (mostly used in advanced coding).

Example:

let id = Symbol("uniqueId");

B. Non-Primitive Data Type
8. Object

Used to store multiple values in key-value pairs.

Example:

let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 22
};

Types of Objects

Objects include:

Arrays

Functions

Dates

Objects

Array Example:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

Function Example:
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
Question 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?
ANS:1. undefined

Means a variable has been declared but not assigned any value.

It is the default value of uninitialized variables.

Set automatically by JavaScript.

Example:
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

2. null

It represents intentional emptiness.

Used when a programmer wants to say:
"This variable has no value."

Must be assigned manually.

Example:
let b = null;
console.log(b); // null


JavaScript Operators


Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.
• Arithmetic operators
• Assignment operators
• Comparison operators
• Logical operators
ANS:1. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical calculations.
| Operator | Meaning             | Example           |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `5 + 3 = 8`       |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `10 - 4 = 6`      |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `6 * 2 = 12`      |
| `/`      | Division            | `20 / 4 = 5`      |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `10 % 3 = 1`      |
| `**`     | Exponent (power)    | `2 ** 3 = 8`      |
| `++`     | Increment           | `let a = 5; a++;` |
| `--`     | Decrement           | `let a = 5; a--;` |
2. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.
| Operator | Meaning             | Example                |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `=`      | Assign value        | `let a = 10`           |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `a += 5` → `a = a + 5` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 3`               |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 2`               |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `a /= 4`               |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | `a %= 2`               |
3. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values and return true or false.
| Operator | Meaning                     | Example             |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to                    | `5 == '5'` → true   |
| `===`    | Strict equal (type + value) | `5 === '5'` → false |
| `!=`     | Not equal                   | `5 != 3`            |
| `!==`    | Strict not equal            | `5 !== '5'`         |
| `>`      | Greater than                | `8 > 5`             |
| `<`      | Less than                   | `3 < 5`             |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal            | `10 >= 10`          |
| `<=`     | Less or equal               | `4 <= 6`            |
4. Logical Operators

Used to combine or invert conditions.
| Operator | Meaning | Example                    |    |          |   |                 |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------- | -- | -------- | - | --------------- |
| `&&`     | AND     | `(5 > 2 && 10 > 5)` → true |    |          |   |                 |
| `        |         | `                          | OR | `(5 > 10 |   | 10 > 5)` → true |
| `!`      | NOT     | `!(5 > 2)` → false         |    |          |   |                 |
Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
ANS:1. == (Loose Equality)

Compares value only

Performs type conversion (changes data type before comparing)

Can give unexpected results

Example:
5 == "5"     // true  (string "5" converted to number 5)
0 == false   // true

2. === (Strict Equality)

Compares value AND data type

No type conversion

Safer and recommended

Example:
5 === "5"    // false  (number vs string)
0 === false  // false
10 === 10    // true


Control Flow (If-Else, Switch)

Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work withan
example
ANS:Control flow is the order in which JavaScript executes statements in a program.
By default, code runs from top to bottom, but with control flow statements (like if, else, loops, switch), we can change the order based on conditions.

Control flow helps the program make decisions and execute different code depending on situations.

How if-else statements work

if-else statements allow JavaScript to check a condition and run code only when the condition is true.
If the condition is false, JavaScript runs the else part (or else if if provided).

 Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a
switch statement instead of if-else?
ANS:A switch statement is used to compare one value against multiple possible cases.
It checks the value, matches it with a case, and executes the code for that case.

Syntax:
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;

    case value2:
        // code
        break;

    default:
        // code runs when no case matches
}

Example:
let day = 3;

switch(day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}

Explanation:

day is compared to each case

When day == 3, it prints "Wednesday"

break stops the switch from running other cases

default runs if no case matches

When should you use a switch instead of if-else?

Use a switch when:

You have many conditions to check for the same value

Each condition is a fixed value (1, 2, 3… or strings like "red", "blue")

Examples of good use cases for switch:

Menu selection

Checking days of the week

Checking user roles (admin, user, guest)

Choosing operations based on a number or string


Loops (For, While, Do-While)
Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic
example of each.
ANS:Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition becomes false.
JavaScript has three main loops: for, while, and do-while.

1. for Loop

Used when you know how many times you want to run the loop.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to run
}

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


Output: 1 2 3 4 5

2. while Loop

Used when you don’t know the exact number of iterations and want to keep looping while a condition is true.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // code to run
}

Example:
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}


Output: 1 2 3 4 5

3. do-while Loop

Always runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

Condition is checked after running the loop.

Syntax:
do {
    // code to run
} while (condition);

Example:
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);


Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
ANS:
1. Condition Check

while loop checks the condition before running the loop.

do-while loop checks the condition after running the loop.

2. Execution

while loop may run 0 times if the condition is false at the beginning.

do-while loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

3. Syntax Difference

while loop:

while (condition) {
    // code
}


do-while loop:

do {
    // code
} while (condition);

Example:
while loop:
let x = 5;
while (x < 5) {   // false → loop does NOT run
    console.log(x);
}

do-while loop:
let y = 5;
do {
    console.log(y);  // runs once
} while (y < 5);


Functions
 Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a
function.
ANS:Functions in JavaScript are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
They help to:

Reduce code repetition

Make programs easier to understand

Make code organized and reusable

A function runs only when it is called (invoked).

Syntax for declaring a function
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example:
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, welcome!");
}

Calling (Invoking) a function

To run a function, use its name with parentheses.

Syntax:
functionName();

Example:
greet();  // calls the function


Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function
expression?
ANS:1. Function Declaration

A function declaration defines a function using the function keyword with a name.
It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.

Example:

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

greet();  // can be called before or after definition

2. Function Expression

A function expression stores a function inside a variable.
It is not hoisted, so it can be called only after it is defined.

Example:

const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};

greet();  // can only be called after definition

Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
ANS:1. Parameters

Parameters are variables listed in a function definition.
They are used to receive input values when the function is called.

Example:

function multiply(a, b) {   // a and b are parameters
    console.log(a * b);
}

multiply(4, 5);  // 4 and 5 are arguments

2. Return Values

A return value is the value that a function sends back to the place where it was called.
The return keyword is used to return a value from a function.

Example:

function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;  // returns result
}

let result = add(10, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 15

Arrays

Question 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array?
ANS:An array in JavaScript is a special variable that can store multiple values in a single variable.
The values are stored in an ordered list and each value has an index number, starting from 0.

Example values an array can store:

Numbers

Strings

Booleans

Objects

How to declare and initialize an array
Method 1: Using square brackets [] (most common)
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

Method 2: Using the Array constructor
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);

Accessing elements of an array
let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Red
console.log(colors[1]); // Green

 Question 2: Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays.
ANS:1. push()

✅ Adds a new element to the end of the array.

Example:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits.push("mango");

console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

2. pop()

✅ Removes the last element from the array.

Example:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
fruits.pop();

console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana"]

3. shift()

✅ Removes the first element from the array.

Example:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
fruits.shift();

console.log(fruits); // ["banana", "mango"]

4. unshift()

✅ Adds a new element to the beginning of the array.

Example:

let fruits = ["banana", "mango"];
fruits.unshift("apple");

console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

Objects

Question 1: What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?
ANS:An object in JavaScript is a collection of key–value pairs used to store related data and functions in a structured way.
Each key is called a property, and its value can be any data type.

Example of an object:
let person = {
  name: "Rahul",
  age: 25,
  city: "Delhi"
};

Question 2: Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and
bracket notation.
ANS:In JavaScript, object properties can be accessed and updated in two ways:

Example Object:
let person = {
  name: "Amit",
  age: 22,
  city: "Delhi"
};

1. Dot Notation
✅ Accessing a property:
console.log(person.name);  // Output: Amit

✅ Updating a property:
person.age = 25;
console.log(person.age);  // Output: 25

2. Bracket Notation
✅ Accessing a property:
console.log(person["city"]);  // Output: Delhi

✅ Updating a property:
person["name"] = "Rahul";
console.log(person["name"]);  // Output: Rahul

JavaScript Events

Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners
ANS:JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser and are triggered by the user or the system.

Common examples of events:

Clicking a button (click)

Pressing a key (keydown)

Moving the mouse (mouseover)

Submitting a form (submit)

Page loading (load)

Events allow the webpage to respond to user actions.

Role of Event Listeners

An event listener is a piece of code that waits for a specific event to happen and then runs a function when that event occurs.

Event listeners connect events to JavaScript functions, making the webpage interactive.

Syntax:
element.addEventListener("event", function);

Example:
let btn = document.getElementById("myBtn");

btn.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
});

How it works:

It “listens” for a click event on the button

When the button is clicked, the function runs


Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an
example.
ANS:The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler to an HTML element.
It “listens” for a specific event (like click, mouseover, keydown) and runs a function when that event happens.

Syntax:
element.addEventListener("event", function);

How it works

Selects an HTML element

Attaches an event to it

Executes the function when the event occurs

Example:
HTML:
<button id="btn">Click Me</button>

JavaScript:
let button = document.getElementById("btn");

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

DOM Manipulation

Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript
interact with the DOM?
ANS:The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure that represents all the elements of an HTML document as objects.
It allows JavaScript to access, change, add, or delete HTML elements and their content.

In simple words:
👉 The DOM is a programming interface that represents a web page so JavaScript can modify it.

How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?

JavaScript interacts with the DOM by using built-in methods to:

✅ Select elements
✅ Change content
✅ Change styles
✅ Add or remove elements
✅ Respond to events

Common DOM Methods
Select elements:
document.getElementById("id");
document.getElementsByClassName("class");
document.getElementsByTagName("tag");
document.querySelector("selector");

Change content:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";

Change style:
document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";

Add element:
let p = document.createElement("p");
document.body.appendChild(p);

Question 2: Explain the methods getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(),and
querySelector() used to select elements from the DOM.
ANS:1. getElementById()

Selects one element using its unique id.

Returns a single element object.

Syntax & Example:

let element = document.getElementById("heading");

<h1 id="heading">Hello</h1>

2. getElementsByClassName()

Selects multiple elements that share the same class name.

Returns an HTMLCollection (array-like object).

Syntax & Example:

let items = document.getElementsByClassName("box");

<div class="box">Box 1</div>
<div class="box">Box 2</div>


Access with index:

items[0].style.color = "red";

3. querySelector()

Selects the first matching element using a CSS selector.

Syntax & Example:

let element = document.querySelector(".box");


This can select:

#id → by id

.class → by class

tag → by tag

Example:

document.querySelector("#heading");
document.querySelector(".box");
document.querySelector("p");


JavaScript Timing Events (setTimeout, setInterval)


 Question 1: Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. Howare
they used for timing events?
ANS:1. setTimeout()

setTimeout() is used to run a function once after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

Syntax:

setTimeout(function, time);


Example:

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Hello after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);  // 2000 ms = 2 seconds


✅ Runs only once after the delay.

2. setInterval()

setInterval() is used to run a function repeatedly at fixed time intervals.

Syntax:

setInterval(function, time);


Example:

setInterval(function() {
  console.log("This runs every 1 second");
}, 1000);


✅ Runs continuously every given interval.

How they are used for timing events

They are used to:

Delay execution of code

Create clocks or timers

Run animations

Auto-refresh data

Question 2: Provide an example of how to use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2
seconds.
ANS:Here is a simple example of using setTimeout() to delay an action by 2 seconds:

✅ Example: Delay an action by 2 seconds
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This message appears after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

🔎 Explanation (in simple words)

setTimeout() schedules the function to run later

2000 means 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds

After 2 seconds, the message is printed

HTML + JS Example (Button click → delayed message)
<button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

<script>
  function showMessage() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      alert("Action performed after 2 seconds!");
    }, 2000);
  }
</script>

JavaScript Error Handling

Question 1: What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally
blocks with an example.
ANS:Error handling in JavaScript is a way to catch and manage runtime errors so that the program does not crash.
It helps the program run smoothly even if something goes wrong.

JavaScript uses the try...catch...finally blocks for error handling.

1. try Block

Contains the code that may cause an error.

2. catch Block

Runs if an error occurs in the try block.

It receives the error information.

3. finally Block

Runs always, whether an error occurs or not.

Used for cleanup code.

Example:
try {
  let result = 10 / 0;
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("This will always execute");
}

Output:
Infinity
This will always execute


(If there was a real error, the catch block would run.)

Another Example with Real Error
try {
  let x = y + 10;  // y is not defined → error
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error:", error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("Program finished");
}


Question 2: Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?
ANS:Error handling is important because it helps a JavaScript application run smoothly and safely even when unexpected problems occur.

Main reasons why error handling is important:

Prevents program crashes
It stops the entire application from stopping when an error occurs.

Improves user experience
Instead of showing a broken page, friendly error messages can be shown.

Helps in debugging
It provides useful error messages that help developers find and fix problems.

Maintains application stability
Keeps the app running even if part of the code fails.

Improves security
Stops sensitive error details from being shown to users.
